# My config files for Hyprland

A working configuration of Hyprland for Arch-based Linux

## Installation

- [ ] Copy config files to your $HOME/.config directory
- [ ] Copy icons and themes to your $HOME/.local directory
- [ ] Install necessary software
- [ ] Enjoy

## Note

This config will no longer have update!!!

## My suggestion

For Arch Linux the best choice is to use ML4W Hyprland of Stephan Raabe
